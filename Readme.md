# GAME: African Capitals

## About Game

A game that displays a country and asks the player to enter the capital for the country displayed. After the player enters the capital, it will display another country and ask for the capital, and repeat the process until the player has answered the capital for ten countries. Then, display the player's score at the end of the game. For each capital the user enters correctly, % points will be awarded.

Download the attached csv file(african_countries.csv), then read the file to get the countries and their capital. It's a csv file, with the first column representing the country and the second representing the capital. Note Some countries have more than one capital, which should be taken into consideration. Where you have multiple capitals, the capitals are separated by '\*'. The country and capital(s) should be stored in an array.

Questions are asked in a random order as such no countries are repeated during a game.

Each game shows the player only 10 Countries, one at a time, after which the game ends.
